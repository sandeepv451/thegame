# SNAKESSSSSSSSs <- Plural!!!
Welcome to SNAKESSSSSSSSs:snake::snake::snake::. This is an ORIGINAL, NEW AND IMPROVED, take on the original game of Snake. 

You're probably thinking, "Wow, Snake? The game whose design dates back to the arcade game Blockade,[3][4] developed and published by Gremlin in 1976.[5] It was cloned as Bigfoot Bonkers the same year? Which, in 1977, Atari released two Blockade-inspired titles: the arcade game Dominos and Atari VCS game Surround.[6] Surround was one of the nine Atari VCS (later the Atari 2600) launch titles in the United States and was also sold by Sears under the name Chase. That same year, a similar game was launched for the Bally Astrocade as Checkmate."
