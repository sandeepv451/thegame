# :snake: Worms Evolution: Fertilize or Be Fertilized :snake:
Welcome to the sequal to the [original Snake game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)), Worms Evolution: Fertilize or Be Fertilized.

You're probably thinking, "Wow, Snake? The game whose design dates back to the arcade game Blockade, developed and published by Gremlin in 1976? The game that was cloned as Bigfoot Bonkers the same year? Which, in 1977, Atari released two Blockade-inspired titles: the arcade game Dominos and Atari VCS game Surround?? The game where, Surround was one of the nine Atari VCS (later the Atari 2600) launch titles in the United States and was also sold by Sears under the name Chase??? The game where, that same year, a similar game was launched for the Bally Astrocade as Checkmate?????"

No. This is that game. This game is better, newer, faster. 

In :snake:Worms Evolution: Fertilize or Be Fertilized:snake:, you play as a lowly snake trying to work your way up from poverty. Ever year, the Hungry Games where the best of the best worms are send into a battle arena to prove who can fertilize the most :leaf:organic:leaf:. 

Dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge your way around other hungry worms trying to catch you off guard and steal your hard work! The red potatoes are worm 1 point, the green potatoes are worth 5 points, and the legendary golden potatoes are worth...
